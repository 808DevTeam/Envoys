# Envoys
Chests randomly spawn in warzone

use /setenvoy to setup the chest also replace the chest once they are done.


also when your doing the positions for the envoys in the Envoys.yml

if its 175.1931:65.819:93.9181
change it to 175:65:93
for it works also do /whereami when standing on the chest to make sure thats the right postion

thanks for support my plugin and have a great day
